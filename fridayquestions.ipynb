Examples of data science can be the use of data to answer important questions or make business is better. An example of this is telehealth company finding out why there are a small amount of patients in one state versus another state using data to figure out as to why and how to reach out to those people.\n"

This summary typically includes basic statistics like counts, averages, measures of distribution, and variability. It helps you get a sense of what's going on with your data without delving into the reasons behind it.\n",

        "\n",
        " Diagnostic analytics- while descriptive analytics tells us what happened in the past, diagnostic analytics goes a step further to uncover why it happened. It's like trying to find the root cause or reasons behind certain events or trends in data.It involves analyzing data and using various techniques to uncover hidden patterns, anomalies, or causes behind specific outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "examples of it: Employee Retention: Human resources departments use diagnostic analytics to understand why employees are leaving a company. By analyzing employee data and conducting exit interviews, they can identify factors such as job dissatisfaction, inadequate compensation, or issues with company culture contributing to turnover.\n",
